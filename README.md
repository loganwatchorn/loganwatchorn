# Welcome!
Hi, my name's Logan! I'm a software engineer based near Vancouver, Canada, holding a BMath from UWaterloo. My GitHub is home to my passion projects.

This July & August I'm learning CUDA from the textbook "Programming Massively Parallel Processors". After that I'll do some low-level machine learning projects.

Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganwatchorn) or [Twitter](https://www.x.com/logan_watchorn).

Cheers!
